Add support for `--all` flag to add all snippets. By default, we only install a
minimal/recommended set of snippets.

> **Recommended snippets:** provider, avatar, button, checkbox, radio,
> input-group, slider, popover, dialog, drawer, tooltip, field

If you want to add all snippets, you can use the `--all` flag.
