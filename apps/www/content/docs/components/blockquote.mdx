<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`blockquote` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add blockquote
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Blockquote`
component.

```jsx
import { Blockquote } from "@/components/ui/blockquote"
```

```jsx
<Blockquote dash cite="Uzumaki Naruto" citeUrl="#">
  If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Each
  one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without
  comparing himself to anyone else.
</Blockquote>
```

## Examples

### With Cite

Use the `cite` prop to provide the source of the blockquote. This will be
displayed below the blockquote.
