description: Used to force a part of the tree to light or dark mode.

<ExampleTabs name="theme-basic" />

## Usage

```jsx
import { Theme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Theme appearance="dark">
  <div />
</Theme>
```

## Examples

### Nested

The theme can be nested to apply different appearances to different parts of the
tree. This is useful for applying a global appearance and then overriding some
parts of it.

> Good to know: We use native CSS selectors to achieve this.

<ExampleTabs name="theme-nested" />

### Portalled

Use the `asChild` prop to force the appearance of portalled elements like the
popover and modal content.

<ExampleTabs name="theme-with-portalled" />
