## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`close-button` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add close-button
```

The snippet includes a `CloseButton` component composition based on the
`IconButton` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { CloseButton } from "@/components/ui/close-button"
```

```jsx
<CloseButton />
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the close button.

<ExampleTabs name="close-button-with-sizes" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the appearance of the close button.

<ExampleTabs name="close-button-with-variants" />

### Without Snippet

If you don't want to use the snippet, you can use the `IconButton` component
from the `@chakra-ui/react` package.

<ExampleTabs name="close-button-without-snippet" />

## Props

<PropTable component="Button" part="Button" />
