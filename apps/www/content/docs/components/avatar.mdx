The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Avatar` component.

import { Avatar } from "@/components/ui/avatar"
```

```jsx
<Avatar name="Segun Adebayo" src="https://bit.ly/sage-adebayo" loading="lazy" />
```

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-sizes" />

### Shape

Use the `shape` prop to change the shape of the avatar, from `round` to `square`

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-shape" />

### Fallback

The initials of the name can be used as a fallback when the `src` prop is not
provided or when the image fails to load.

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-fallback" />

### Ring

Use the `outline*` props to add a ring around the avatar

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-ring" />
