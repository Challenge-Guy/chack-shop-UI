## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`avatar` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add avatar
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Avatar` and
`AvatarGroup` components.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Avatar, AvatarGroup } from "@/components/ui/avatar"
```

```jsx
<AvatarGroup>
  <Avatar />
</AvatarGroup>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the avatar

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-sizes" />

### Shape

Use the `shape` prop to change the shape of the avatar, from `rounded` to
`square`

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-shape" />

### Fallback

The initials of the name can be used as a fallback when the `src` prop is not
provided or when the image fails to load.

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-fallback" />

### Ring

Use the `outline*` props to add a ring around the avatar

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-ring" />

### Group

Use the `Group` component to group multiple avatars together

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-group" />

### Stacking

When using the `AvatarGroup` component, you can use the `stacking` prop to
change the stacking order of the avatars

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-group-with-stacking" />

### Badge

Show a badge on the right corner of the avatar by composing the `Float` and
`Circle` components

<ExampleTabs name="avatar-with-badge" />
