## Installation

:::steps

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react next-themes
```

### Setup provider

Create a `Provider` component at the root of your application. This provider
composes the following:

- `ChakraProvider` from `@chakra-ui/react` for the styling system
- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` for color mode

```tsx title="src/components/provider.tsx"
import { ChakraProvider, defaultSystem } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes"

export function Provider(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider value={defaultSystem}>
      <ThemeProvider attribute="class" disableTransitionOnChange>
        {props.children}
      </ThemeProvider>
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

Next, wrap your application with the `Provider` component at the root of your
application.

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
import App from "./App"
import { Provider } from "./components/provider"

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

### Update tsconfig

If you're using TypeScript, you need to update the `compilerOptions` in the
tsconfig file to include the following options:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

### Add snippets

Snippets are pre-built components that you can use to build your UI faster.
Using the `@chakra-ui/cli` you can add snippets to your project.

```bash
npx @chakra-ui/cli@next snippet add
```

### Enjoy!

When the power of the snippets and the primitive components from Chakra UI, you
can build your UI faster.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { HStack } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <HStack>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </HStack>
  )
}
```

## Known issues

You may encounter the following issues when using Chakra UI with Remix:

```bash
Error: There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering.
```

This is a known issue related to extension installed in your browser. We
recommend testing your application in incognito mode to see if the issue
persists.
